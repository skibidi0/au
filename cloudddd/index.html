        <p>Cloud automation refers to the implementation of tools and processes in an effort to reduce the manual
            intervention associated with provisioning, configuring, and managing public, private, and hybrid cloud
            environments. Get a free assessment. See our cloud performance solutions.</p>

        <h2>5 Types of Cloud Automation</h2>
       
        <li><b>Resource allocation. Autoscaling</b></li>
        <p>the ability to scale up and down the use of compute, memory or networking resources to match demand -- is a
            core tenet of cloud computing. It provides elasticity in resource usage and enables the pay-as-you-go cloud
            cost model.</p>
        <li><b>Configurations.</b></li>
        <p>Infrastructure configurations can be defined through templates and code and implemented automatically. In the
            cloud, opportunities for integration increase with associated cloud services.</p>
        <li><b>Development and deployment. </b></li>
        <p>Continuous software development relies upon automation for various steps, from code scans and version control
            to testing and deployment.</p>
        <li><b>Tagging</b></li>
        <p>Assets can be tagged automatically based on specific criteria, context and conditions of operation.</p>
        <li><b>Security</b></li>
        <p>Cloud environments can be set up with automated security controls that enable or restrict access to apps or
            data, and scan for vulnerabilities and unusual performance levels.</p>
        <li><b>Logging and monitoring.</b></li>
        <p>Cloud tools and functions can be set up to log all activity involving services and workloads in an
            environment. Monitoring filters can be set up to look for anomalies or unexpected events.</p>

    <div class="benefits">
        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        
        <li><b>1. Reduces errors</b>:</li>
        <p>Monotony leads to complacency. It becomes a lot like driving. Experienced drivers find themselves making
            errors, not because they’ve forgotten the basics but largely because they’ve become comfortable and less
            cautious on the road. It’s pretty much the same with performing the same mundane tasks repeatedly.

            Employees become bored and absent-minded which is a breeding ground for errors. Cloud automation can help
            you eliminate these mistakes.</p>
        <li><b>2. Saves time</b></li>
        <p>Manually performing repetitive tasks can be tedious and can take up precious work time. If you have employees
            with multiple responsibilities, automation can help ease the pressure and help them focus on their more
            important tasks.
        </p>
        <li><b>3. Efficiency</b></li>
        <p>Cloud automation makes workflows more efficient. It can help your software engineering team establish
            continuous deployment strategies. You can use cloud automation to detect bugs and remedy them as swiftly as
            possible.</p>

    <div class="challenges">
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
       
        <li><b>1. Safety concerns</b></li>
        <p>Most vendors strive to ensure that their cloud services are as secure as possible. Nevertheless, data leaks
            are still possible. This is a great concern to companies worried about ransomware attacks.

            While the number of worldwide ransomware attacks has steadily decreased in the last 6 years, 2020 saw a
            sharp incline. This is something you may have to consider before committing to a cloud automation solution
        </p>
        <li><b>2. Requires reliable network connectivity</b></li>
        <p>Public cloud services are based on a wide area network. To access them, you’ll need a steady and reliable
            internet connection. Even with a trustworthy service provider, mishaps do occur and you might find yourself
            stranded if the internet goes down.</p>
        <li><b>3. Platform lock-in</b></li>
        <p>Choosing a cloud service provider is a huge commitment. Going further and automating important business
            processes means you’ll be further locked in. It becomes marriage-like. You may eventually decide to migrate
            to another service provider later which is very costly. Once you decide on a platform and partner, you’re in
            it for the long haul.</p>
